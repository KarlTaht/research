# Full training config for ~10M parameter CustomTransformer
# Purpose: Train on complete TinyStories dataset
#
# Model: ~10.4M params (d=288, L=8, balanced depth/width)
# Data: Full ~2.1M training examples
# Expected runtime: Several hours depending on hardware
#
# NOTE: CustomTransformer with manual backprop requires higher LR than typical
# PyTorch models due to gradient scaling. lr=0.1 works well; lr=0.0003 is too low.
